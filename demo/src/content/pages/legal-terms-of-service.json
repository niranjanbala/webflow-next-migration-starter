&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

Agreement commences on the date you first used the Services and will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.  Numeral may, with or without notice, terminate or suspend this Agreement (including the Services), at any time and for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

Agreement commences on the date you first used the Services and will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.  Numeral may, with or without notice, terminate or suspend this Agreement (including the Services), at any time and for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

Agreement commences on the date you first used the Services and will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.  Numeral may, with or without notice, terminate or suspend this Agreement (including the Services), at any time and for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

Agreement commences on the date you first used the Services and will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.  Numeral may, with or without notice, terminate or suspend this Agreement (including the Services), at any time and for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

Agreement commences on the date you first used the Services and will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.  Numeral may, with or without notice, terminate or suspend this Agreement (including the Services), at any time and for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

Agreement commences on the date you first used the Services and will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.  Numeral may, with or without notice, terminate or suspend this Agreement (including the Services), at any time and for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

including without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses, arising or resulting from (i) your breach of this Agreement, (ii) your breach of applicable law, (iii) any of Your

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof). &nbsp;All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion. &nbsp;You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.</p><h1><strong>19. &nbsp;ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></h1><p><strong>&nbsp;Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. &nbsp;It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights. &nbsp;It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></p><p><a href=\"#\"><strong>19.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

if Numeral is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).  You agree that all terminations for cause are made in Numeral’s sole discretion, and that Numeral shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.  If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services.  Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.  Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the Services.  Any termination of this Agreement shall not affect Numeral’s rights hereunder, including all accrued rights to payment and the terms of Sections 3, 5-6, 8-12, 14-18, and 21. Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).  All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion.  You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.19.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.19.1        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20. GENERAL PROVISIONS20.1        Electronic Communications.  The communications between you and Numeral may take place via electronic means, whether you visit the Service or send Numeral emails, or whether Numeral posts notices on the Service or communicates with you via email.  For contractual purposes, you (i) consent to receive communications from Numeral in an electronic form; and (ii) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Numeral electronically provides to you satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing.  The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including but not limited to the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq.

want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services. &nbsp;Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services. &nbsp;Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof). &nbsp;All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion. &nbsp;You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.</p><h1><strong>19. &nbsp;ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></h1><p><strong>&nbsp;Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. &nbsp;It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights. &nbsp;It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></p><p><a href=\"#\"><strong>19.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20.

want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying Numeral at any time and (ii) closing your account for the Services. &nbsp;Your notice should be sent to Numeral at help@numeralhq.com.

Numeral reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof). &nbsp;All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Numeral upon any termination of your Numeral account in its sole discretion. &nbsp;You may terminate your Numeral account at any time from within your account settings.</p><h1><strong>19. &nbsp;ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></h1><p><strong>&nbsp;Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. &nbsp;It is part of your contract with Numeral and affects your rights. &nbsp;It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></p><p><a href=\"#\"><strong>19.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</strong></a>Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Numeral agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a <strong>“Dispute”</strong>) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and Numeral may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). &nbsp;For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>19.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;</strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral. &nbsp;If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. &nbsp;You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). &nbsp;You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). &nbsp;If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@numeralhq.com\">help@numeralhq.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at <a href=\"#\">527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105</a>. &nbsp;The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. &nbsp;In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. &nbsp;Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp;The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p><strong>19.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;</strong>YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>19.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> &nbsp;YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. &nbsp;ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. &nbsp;Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. &nbsp;This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>19.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Forum.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <em>et seq.</em>, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. &nbsp;If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the <strong>“Request”</strong>). &nbsp;The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. &nbsp;Such counsel must also sign the Request. &nbsp;By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p><p>Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. &nbsp;Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. &nbsp;If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p><p>You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><p><strong>19.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitrator.</strong> &nbsp;The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p><p><strong>19.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;</strong>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration). &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. &nbsp;</strong>The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &nbsp;If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. &nbsp;The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p><strong>19.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Batch Arbitration. &nbsp;</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. &nbsp;To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>). &nbsp;In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. &nbsp;The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.</p><p>You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p><strong>19.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p><p><strong>19.11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalidity, Expiration. &nbsp;</strong>Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. &nbsp;You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. &nbsp;Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>19.12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modification. &nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. &nbsp;Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. &nbsp;Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. &nbsp;If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. &nbsp;Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</p><h1><strong>20.

and (ii) you or Numeral may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.19.2        Informal Dispute Resolution.  There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Numeral.  If that occurs, Numeral is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.  You and Numeral agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).  You and Numeral therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”).  If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to Numeral that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to help@numeralhq.com or regular mail to our offices located at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.19.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND NUMERAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Numeral are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 19.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement).  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.19.4        Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND NUMERAL AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 19.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Numeral agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California.  All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.  This section does not prevent you or Numeral from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.19.5        Rules and Forum.  This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.  If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Numeral agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.  The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”).  The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account on our Service; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  Such counsel must also sign the Request.  By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Numeral otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.  If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.You and Numeral agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.19.6        Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.19.7        Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 19.9 (Batch Arbitration).  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.19.8        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  If you or Numeral need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.  The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.19.9        Batch Arbitration.  To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Numeral agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Numeral by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Numeral.You and Numeral agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.19.10      30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.19.11      Invalidity, Expiration.  Except as provided in Section 19.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Numeral as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.  Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.19.12      Modification.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Numeral makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you.  Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Numeral at 527 Howard St. Fl 3 San Francisco, California 94105, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.  If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect.  Numeral will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.20. GENERAL PROVISIONS20.1        Electronic Communications.  The communications between you and Numeral may take place via electronic means, whether you visit the Service or send Numeral emails, or whether Numeral posts notices on the Service or communicates with you via email.  For contractual purposes, you (i) consent to receive communications from Numeral in an electronic form; and (ii) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Numeral electronically provides to you satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing.  The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including but not limited to the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq.
